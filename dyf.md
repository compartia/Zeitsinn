```
Don’t you feel ...? (I know you feel it)
Subtle movement of your seldom, 
neat and quiet breeze of words
on my infra-reddish features.

Lips of yours beseech the desert 
of my gaze for quenching water
Don’t you feel ...? (I know you feel it)
Heat of tractor beams I’m spelling
on your mouth through the blackness 
of my wide portraying  lenses.  

In the smoking filaments
 all I sense is prominence 
Of an airy “kiss me” Please, 
Allow this 
and I will.


Don’t you feel ...? (I know you feel it)
Silent scream of helpless puppet
twisted, spinning, slings are tangled,
falling freely to the center
of the Messier 87 
supermassive
interstellar 
ergosphere 
of your brightly flaming iris  

Don’t you feel ...? (I know you feel it)
Glowing with the heated fairings
I am entering your Roche lobe
My controllers nearly failing
My cuirass to jettison, the probe
To init touchdown sequence.
Yoptaaaaa 

Don’t you feel ...? (I know you feel it)
Weights of minutes, head is filled with,
Seek a nest inside your plexus
In between your hips of lotus. 
Make me laptop, run the game

I've been peeping in the Future
Seen you dancing there, nude. 
Mute my silliest foreseeing, 
Cover my forehead with palm,
Palm of gentle amber fire.

No, I beg, please amplify it.
