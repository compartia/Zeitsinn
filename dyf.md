```
Don’t you feel it ...? (I know you feel it)
Subtle movement of your seldom,
neat and quiet breeze of words
on my infra-reddish features.

Your lips beseech the desert
of my gaze for quenching water

Don’t you feel it...? (I know you feel it)
Heat from tractor beams I’m spelling
onto your mouth through the blackness
of my wide portraying  lenses.  

In the smoking filaments
 all I sense is prominence 
Of an airy “kiss me”. Please,
Allow this 
and I will.

Don’t you feel it...? (I know you feel it)
Silent scream of a helpless puppet
twisted, spinning, slings are tangled,
falling freely to the center
of the Messier 87 
supermassive 
interstellar 
ergosphere 
of your brightly flaming iris  

Don’t you feel it ...? (I know you feel it)
Glowing with the heated fairings
I am entering your Roche lobe
My controllers nearly failing
My cuirass to jettison, the probe
To initiate touchdown sequence.
Yoptaaaaa

Don’t you feel it ...? (I know you feel it)
My head is filled with the weight of minutes,
Seeks a nest inside your plexus
In between the lotus of your hips
Make me your laptop, run the game

I've been peeping in the Future
Seen you dancing there, nude.
Mute my silliest foresight,
Cover my forehead with palm,
Palm of gentle amber fire.
No, I beg you, please amplify
